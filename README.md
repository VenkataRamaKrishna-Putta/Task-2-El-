In this task, we focused on performing key SQL operations—INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE—on a relational database. We used the INSERT statement to add sample records into the Products, Customers, and Orders tables. The UPDATE statement was used to modify specific fields such as product prices, customer addresses, and order quantities. Finally, the DELETE statement allowed us to remove selected records from the tables, ensuring referential integrity by carefully handling dependencies involving foreign keys. These operations helped reinforce our understanding of basic data manipulation in SQL.
